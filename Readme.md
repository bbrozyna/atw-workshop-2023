Note that this repo is not a complete solution, but rather a starting point for the workshop. 
Full of delibratly broken code.



During Workshop
You will work in groups of 3-5 people. 
Together by exploratory test and code audit you will try to undestand how appliaction works.

Then you will reorginze test and map them to actual business requirements.

## Test naming convention

For the e2e tests in repo please use following guidelines:
1. For the suffix, please use `*.spec.js` for test level clarity
2. Test file names should describe main tested area. Example: `cart.spec.js`. 
For longer names please use camelCase convention.
3. Test suites should combine `describe` and `it` blocks into the one phrase 
explaining the test intention. Example
```javascript
describe('Collections', () => {
    it("are displayed and filtered by trending", () => {
    })
```
